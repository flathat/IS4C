# A version of ../special/ for copying (mirroring) tables from this server on
#  another server.  My use is making realistic test data.
# See ../special/README on how the files in this directory are used.
# Generally, a symlink named for a table, pointing to a special handler
#  that uses mysqldump to transfer tables.
